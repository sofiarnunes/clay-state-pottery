# Clay State Pottery Website
## Front-end course Project

This website was created and programmed by me. The aim was to apply the knowledge gained in the Front-end Development course. I opted for a brand that doesn't exist that sells pottery in its own way with its own concepts.

The design was very restrict, so that everyone could be evaluated in the same level.
